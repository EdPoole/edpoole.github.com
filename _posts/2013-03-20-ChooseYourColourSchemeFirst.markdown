Lately, this is something that has really come to my attention. I'm often recieving existing branding from clients and asking to use it to create their websites. I have no problem with doing thisâ€“in fact it's considerably easier a lot of the time as the majority of the work has already been completed for me. The issue I have though is when there's a clear lack of consideration for the brand colour scheme. 

I realise that colours are one of those topics where everyone will have an opinion, however (like a lot of these topics) not all opinions are equal. Some colours work together and some just don't. Careful consideration of colour theory will work wonders when choosing a palette for you brand. 

### Colour theory is your friend

Tools like [Adobe Kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/) and websites like [Colour Lovers](http://http://www.colourlovers.com/) are invaluable when it comes to choosing colours. Adobe Kuler has a fantastic interface for picking colours and it allows you to select multiple colour theory "layouts". This should almost always be your first port of call when deciding on your branding.

### A tip for picking the right colours

Often when creating a colour palette, you'll gather a selection of colours that you like. A lot of the time however they may not necessarily work together. I often use this little tip to adjust my colours into something more consistent.

- Open your colour scheme in photoshop. 
- Now pick the colour you think represents your brand the most. 
- Create a new layer and fill this with your chosen colour.
- Set this layer to Overlay and reduce it's opacity to around 25%.

Voila, you now have a much more coherent set of colours for your brand!
