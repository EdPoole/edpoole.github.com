extract: It is time again for my annual site redesign with the token promise of regular content. I have battled before with this and usually end up failing within the first month. Oh well.

I decided early on in the redesign process to drop all images (excluding the dribbble shots from my portfolio) and make my site purely text based. The previous version of my site had large hero images on each page which, in retrospect, were unnecessary as they often did not have any connection to the content on the page.

The fonts have also been updated, with Museo Sans for the small headings and Freight Text Pro for the copy. I have borrowed a trick from [medium.com](http://medium.com), which is to set the copy letter spacing to `-0.01em`. This nudges the text together ever so slightly, improving general readability.
