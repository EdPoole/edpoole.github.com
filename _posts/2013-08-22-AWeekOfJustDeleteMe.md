By the end of Monday we had around 3000 page views. To us, this was the greatest thing ever. Who would have thought that a simple site like just delete me could gain that many views. But that was only the start.

Then last night (Thursday 22nd August),  [WIRED](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/08/just-delete-me/) got hold of it.

Since then, we've had 32,000 visits, 29,400 unique visitors and 42,100 page views. This brings us up to a total of 39.9k total visits, 36.5 unique visitors and 51.7k total page views. This is crazy.

On top of that Robb has been interviewed by Upstart Business about the [NSA/Prism, online businesses and safety on the web](http://upstart.bizjournals.com/companies/innovation/2013/08/23/justdeletme-lets-users-delete-accounts.html).

Wow.
