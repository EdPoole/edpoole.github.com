So, long story short, I broke my blog. What started out as a simple retweaking of fonts ended up being a catastrophic cock-up (for lack of a better word). I moved my blog to edpoole.me and in the process messed up my DNS, pointing it to the wrong place. I was editing the host file associated with my hosting account, however as I wasn't using that to host my blog (I'm using github pages), nothing was taking effect. I finally realised my mistake and edited the correct host file. I'm still kicking myself for the stupidity. Nevermind, Lesson learnt. I'll certainly pay more attention next time.

On top of that, 


### Burning out

Turns out attempting to do too much at once makes my brain go into meltdown. Roughly two weeks ago, everything came to a head. 



### The retweaking

After breaking my site, I took the rework slowly. I'm now using the awesome font pairing of "freight sans pro" and "freight text pro", both of which are available from [typekit]("http://typekit.com"). 

I've also added a focus mode to the blog section of my site. Simply hit the little eye icon in the top right and all irrelevant content is faded out, leaving just the blog post. I write all my posts in iA Writer for Mac, and I loved the distraction free mode Information Architects have included in their app. Realising that my blog posts looked better in Writer than on my site, I "borrowed" their idea and adopted a similar feel on here.
