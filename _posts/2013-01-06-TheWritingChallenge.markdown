2013 has come, and like the joggers you only see at the start of January, I have decided to set myself a "New Year's Resolution".  However unlike the January joggers, I'd like to still be going by February. 

Here's a little confession. I haven't written anything of length in a long time. This probably all stems from my hatred of English whilst in school. Ever since studying maths based subjects at A level, and Computer Science at University, my need to write in well structured prose has rather diminished. Whilst I'm not sorry I stopped studying subjects that required me to write dull, pointless essays, I am rather sorry I stopped writing all together. 

Writing now is much more of a challenge than it was 5 years ago. I may have become much more knowledgable about the industry I'm in, however putting pen to paper and sharing my thoughts has become a lot tougher. In the last 4 years, the only language I have written in for any length of time has been a programming one. I can almost feel my knowledge of vocabulary and spelling leaking out of my body, day on day. 

### How to rectify this?

Obviously there's only one way to "fix" this problem. And that's to start writing again. I have to thank Joel Gascoigne for [this article](http://joel.is/post/32338258448/5-realisations-that-helped-me-write-regularly) on writing regularly. Without that, I'm sure I'd be lost as to where to start. So, let's get this rolling:

__Aim:__ publish at least 1 blog post a week.

Now I've got my aim sorted, I'll lay out a few rules I'll try my best to adhere to:

1. Every Sunday I will publish a blog post.
2. I'll try to make it about something "web-designy" that happened to me during the week.
3. Each post must be around 500 words (+/- 10%)

I'll try to review my situation in roughly a years time. Hopefully come January 2014, I'll have over 50 blog posts under my belt.
