My final year of University is fast approaching. In roughly 5 months time lectures will commence again, and with the start of lectures comes the start of my dissertation. The last few months has been a painful experience, where I have constantly racked my brain in search of something even remotely viable to build for it.

### Coming up with an "idea" is damn near impossible.

I learnt this the hard way. If you deliberately set out to come up with an idea (a web app, for example) you'll almost always find yourself struggling. Most of the time you won't be able to think of anything good, and anything you do manage to think up will most likely be a confused pile of "features" with no real direction. 

This is simply down to one thing. You didn't set out to solve a real problem. Real problems mostly tend to come from real people moaning. Someone may moan that they don't like the way an app works; it is your job to realise their moans are actually carefully disguised opportunities, waiting for the more observant of us to create solutions for.

### Find a problem and the solution will follow.

Sat at work on a Friday afternoon, I was listening to my boss complain as he was completing a task. The task in question was a tedious and manual process, where user error is very much abundant. Conversation sparked up about this process and how we would improve it if we could. 

Suddenly I realised the perfect final year project was sat there in front of me, staring me in the face. There was a clear problem, and we had already started suggesting ways to fix it. I wrote down the fleshed out idea, and being me, immediately ran off to spend Â£35 on a domain and register a twitter account.

So what is this idea? Well, I'll have to see if I can make it first.
