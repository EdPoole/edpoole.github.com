extract: Last week, I spent the best part of an hour ranting at Robb Lewis about the inability to delete my Netflix Account. In a bid to shut me up, he created justdelete.me, a directory of direct links to delete your account from various web services.

A lot of popular web services have taken the approach of using [dark patterns](http://darkpatterns.org) in a bid to prevent the average user from deleting their account. Some choose to hide the delete buttons, while others (I'm looking at you Skype) require you to contact a human and hand over a rather disturbing amount of personal information.

[justdelete.me](http://justdelete.me) aims to fix this by providing a directory of links that take you directly to the page where the "delete account" button is present. The best part of this project is that it is [open source](https://github.com/rmlewisuk/justdelete.me) on github, so if you wish to add a web service that isn't documented, it's as easy as submitting a pull request.

Oh, and I made it look pretty.
