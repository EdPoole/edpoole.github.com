title: Why I turn down freelance jobs.

Over the last few months, since starting my job, I have been presented with a number of freelance opportunities to earn myself "extra cash". Every single one however, I have turned down.

### Freelancing is awesome.

Don't get me wrong, I think freelancing is great; I've even done a fair bit myself. The trouble is, finding the time and motivation to open a client project once you've just finished an 8 hour day at work is really hard. 

I often get home from work at around 6:30pm, which leaves me roughly 5 hours before I head off to bed. In this time I have to cook dinner and wash some clothes amongst other "chores". Even finding the time to sit down and attempt freelancing work is a challenge. 

### Switching off is important.

I don't know anyone that can work every waking minute. We all have to have periods of relaxation - and for good reason. The human body can't keep concentration up for huge lengths of time; we end up burning out.

This is precisely what happened to me when I used to attempt client projects after a full work day. I'd start off positive, but I'd very quickly adopt the attitude of "just getting it done". This mentality doesn't benefit anyone - I'm miserable throughout the entire process and the client ends up with a sub-par project. 

### In step Personal Projects.

I find personal projects have saved me recently. Instead of burning myself out attempting to keep clients happy, I find working on personal projects is a much better use of my spare time. Personal projects allow me complete creative freedom that I'd rarely get with client work. This is especially important when the time I have to work on them is so little. 


### Removing my deadlines increases my productivity.

One of my favourite reasons for working on personal projects are the "lack" of deadlines. This doesn't mean I don't set myself goals (e.g. complete the front end site for project A before next week), however not making these deadlines isn't the end of the world. 

If I'm not 100% happy with the outcome of a certain project, I can easily just not release it and take the time to get it to a standard I'm satisfied with. In this situation, the only person who "loses out" is me. Trying to explain to a client that their project they've paid for will be late because I'm not "completely happy" with the outcome, doesn't always go down well.

### Motivation is of the upmost importance.

At the end of the day, I do my job because I enjoy it. I think working in a creative industry would be very difficult if I received no satisfaction from doing what I do. Personal projects allow me to have full control over both my time and creativity, without having the pressures of adhering to a client's specification.

I may not ship as often as if I was working for a client, but at least when I do, I'm proud to have my name on what I've made.
