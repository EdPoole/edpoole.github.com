extract: I took a couple of weeks off to retweak my blog to make it easier to consume content.

As I was focusing on making it easier to read my content, my first port of call was the fonts. I now use the awesome font combination of Proxima-nova and Adelle, both of which are available on [typekit](http://typekit.com). 

Proxima-nova looks fantastic for headings, where it's large, sans-serif text can be used to full advantage. I believe serif fonts are much easier on the eyes for extended reading though. My first choice was Georgia however it has been used on so many sites that I've grown sick of it. After digging around on Typekit for a while, I stumbled upon the gem that is Adelle.

I've also added a focus mode to the blog section of my site. Simply hit the little focus button in the top left and all irrelevant content is faded out, leaving just the blog post. I write all my posts in iA Writer for Mac, and I loved the distraction free mode Information Architects have included in their app. Realising that my blog posts looked better in Writer than on my site, I "borrowed" their idea and adopted a similar feel on here. Comments have also been hidden away. They're now shown by toggling the "show comments" button at the bottom of each article. 

Finally, in this version of my site, I've actually managed to include a projects section. Here I will be collecting all the fun and interesting things I've worked on and displaying them in one place.
