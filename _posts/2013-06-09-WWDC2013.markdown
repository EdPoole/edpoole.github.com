extract: It's that time of year again where Apple tease us with their new advancements in both iOS and OS X. As the Keynote has just finished, I thought I'd share my gut reaction to today's announcements.

### OS X Mavericks

So, all in all, a solid update to OS X. I'm very excited about the Multiple Displays, and things like App Nap can only do good for the life of my machine.

- __Finder Tabs:__ Excellent, this is definitely more useful than having a tonne of Finder windows open all over the place.

- __Finder Tagging:__ Does anyone actually tag their stuff? 

- __Multiple Displays:__ When multiple desktops were first announced, everyone was rather disappointed by Apple's lack of foresight for people with multiple displays. One of their greatest selling points of OSX Lion was the full screen app, however if you had multiple monitors and made an app full-screen, you would immediately lose the use of your other screen. Mavericks corrects this problem and allows you to control each monitor independently of each other. For me, this is definitely Mavericks' best feature.

- __Safari:__ Some nice features with Reading list and Shared Links, however I can't see myself leaving Chrome any time soon. As a web developer my main concern with Safari is how it seems to be heavily tied to the OS. Hopefully Apple will keep Webkit and Safari up to date as the web changes at its rapid pace.

- __iCloud Keychain:__ I've been using 1Password for ages. Hopefully this will be more useful as it sits as an OS level. 

- __Notification Center:__ Solid improvements, especially the stacked notifications on the lock screen. Reply to messages should hopefully be useful too. 

- __Calendar:__ Thank god they got rid of that old skin. The interface actually looks more usable now too. Facebook integration is nice addition as well.

- __Maps:__ I suppose Apple is trying to do their bit when it comes to maps, but having just got access to the new Google Maps, I can't see myself switching any time soon. Google is just too good at this, and their maps actually show correct data.

- __iBooks:__ Hopefully this will give a better interface to Preview for all the eBooks I have.

### IOS 7

The rumours tend not to be wrong. As predicted, iOS7 is flatter than a pancake. I remember reading [this](http://9to5mac.com/2013/06/09/what-ios7-looks-like/) article on 9to5mac this morning, and almost spat out my coffee at those awful icons. I remember thinking to myself "God, I hope iOS7 doesn't look like this". Shamefully, it does.

I'm unsure as to what Apple were thinking with these icons. More than anything, they're inconsistent as hell. News Stand looks like it was made in paint, passbook has confused drop shadows and Safari looks half finished. Hopefully these will get cleaned up at a later release, however I'm not holding out for anything.

Ignoring the icons, the apps themselves have undergone some quite beautiful improvements.

- __Siri:__ What designer doesn't like thin, white text over blurred backgrounds? Siri seems to be a whole year of Dribbble design trends compiled onto one awesome screen.

- __Mail:__ A truly crisp and clean interface here, as with most of iOS7. The type is what really makes this app. Although I believe it is set in Helvetica Neue, it's beautifully weighted and helps keep the minimal feel beautifully.

- __Weather:__ This is by far the nicest looking app on iOS7. Can't help feel Apple may have [stolen inspiration](http://dribbble.com/search?q=weather+app) from Dribbble though.

- __Messages:__ I'm not completely convinced about the design for messages. I understand Apple are trying to keep to the "flat" theme, however it seems like they have slightly misjudged the design of messages. The curves and padding on the message elements feel off, and on the header bar the spacing between the name and the "messages" back arrow is almost nauseating.

- __Control Center:__ Already present in nearly every jailbroken device, this is a feature iOS users have been requesting for years. Quick access to regularly used controls; always useful.

### Other Surprises.

- __Macbook Air:__ A new macbook air with improved battery life. Awesome. No retina? Not so awesome. I was tempted to get a Macbook Air but decided to get the Retina Macbook Pro instead. Definitely don't regret that after today's announcement.

- __Airport Time Capsule &amp; Airport Extreme:__ Not really anything exciting, however I've been looking into getting a new router/Time Capsule system, so this is a nice surprise.

And finally: 

### Mac Pro

While it admittedly looks rather like the bin in my kitchen, the new Mac Pro is an absolute beast. The ability to support 3 4K external monitors at once is quite possibly the greatest thing I've heard all keynote (Not that I have 3 4K TVs lying about - in fact I'd probably need to rob a bank to acquire the money needed to buy them). Launching in the autumn, I imagine that the price will be nothing less than a starting price of Â£3,500.

Overall, I think this has set Apple up nicely for the next 12 months. I'm excited for the autumn, with (hopefully) new hardware for the iPhone. With the announcement of the Mac Pro, and it's support of 4K monitors, one can only hope for a 27" Retina Thunderbolt display. That would be a nice christmas present Apple. Hint, hint.
