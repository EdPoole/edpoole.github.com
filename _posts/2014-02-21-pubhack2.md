[PubHack 2](http://www.pubhack.co.uk/) took place this tuesday at the [Brewhouse and Kitchen](http://brewhouseandkitchen.com). There was a great turnout, with the entire pub being transformed into something that resembled an Apple showroom, as the majority of people were hacking on Macs.

The theme this round was "First World Problems" - a much more open topic compared to the original Pubhack, which had the theme of "The Apocalypse".

### Our Idea

Based on the theme of "First World Problems", we took the approach of performing a public service to help people deal with their first world problems.

The app begins with a simple screen for users to submit their first world problems. Here, we offered two methods of giving the user an answer. The first used a "mechanical" means of reviewing your first world problem. When you submit your problem, a new screen is loaded with a lovely array of information, telling you why your problem isn't _really_ that big of an issue.

The second, and slightly (VERY) less ethical means of calculating an answer, was the "Sweatshop" method. This used Mechanical Turk to send an email off to India, and they would review your "First World Problem", and return their thoughts. _We're not proud of this feature, honest._

After the user has spent too long on the website, we take drastic action and put a full screen banner over the entire window, informing the user how many people have died in the time they've spent worrying about their silly problem.

### Other Projects

All the hacks this round were of super high quality and can be found [here](http://www.pubhack.co.uk/projects/), on the Pubhack website.

### Thank Yous

Massive thank yous need to be said to [Jo Eyre](http://twitter.com/jo_eyre) and [Lilian Tula](http://twitter.com/lilula), as without them, this awesome event would have never happened. They put a tonne of time and effort into making sure everything ran smoothly, and was enjoyed by everyone. And they also gave out a load of stickers, which I have "carefully" decorated the back of my laptop with!
