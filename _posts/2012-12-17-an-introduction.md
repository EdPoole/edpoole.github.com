extract: So I've finally got round to setting up my blog.

I decided to do so around a year ago, however whenever I'd start building my site, I would always find something else to distract me and it would be put on the back burners. This turned out to be the kiss of death, as every time I revisited my previous works, I was always unhappy and would set about redesigning it. I think the version of this site you're viewing is roughly the 8th iteration of it, and one that I'm finally truely happy with.

I think the reason I've finally decided to stick with this version is simply because how it is built. Previous versions of this site were all CMS (Mostly Wordpress, but other times Anchor) based. Now while CMSs are great if you need to manage content without digging into code, I always found the GUI too bulky and annoying for my needs. I'm a huge fan of markdown, as I love it's simplicity and ease to write. Combining this with my steadily growing (albiet still rather basic) knowledge of version control and git, the perfect solution presented itself to me.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, and is the system used to power [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). The content of this site is generated via Jekyll prior to sticking it on my server. This gives a few awesome benefits. Firstly, it's wicked fast. As we're serving up static HTML pages, there's no waiting time on database lookup or server code execution. Secondly, it's all written using Javascript/HTML/CSS (admittedly Jekyll needs Ruby to run, however it's so insignificant to the overall scale of the site, I'm not counting it). Being a front-end dev, this is awesome for me as I get to stick to my forte, whilst still delivering fast content similarly to the way CMSs do.

Now that I've finally got myself in gear and have begun writing, I'm going to be filling up this blog with everything and anything that I may cross paths with. You can expect to find a lot of OOCSS here however, as this is what I spend the majority of my time writing, and it is what I find most interesting in front-end development.
