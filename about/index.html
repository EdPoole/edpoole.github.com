		<p>Hi, I'm Ed Poole, a Web Designer, Developer, and all round tinkerer from the UK. I currently work at <a href="http://radweb.co.uk">Radweb</a> as a Web Designer and Front-end Developer. You can view my r&eacute;sum&eacute; <a href="/resume/">here</a> .</p>
		<p>I am orginally from an artistic background, having studied the fine arts all though my school years. I fell in love with the web around 2008, when I realised I could use HTML and CSS to bring my designs to life. Since then I have become obsessed with using the web as a canvas for my work.</p>
		<p>My interests surround interface and user experience design. Design is not just about making something look visually appealing; it is about anticipating the decisions a user will make whilst interacting with your system. By fundamentally understanding how someone will react to your design decisions, it allows you to predict and influence their behaviour. This allows us, as designers, to create memorable experiences, which are instinctive to the user.</p>
		<p>My core skills center around Application and Interface Design. I am fluent in Object Oriented CSS and HTML5, and I am proficient in JavaScript and jQuery for DOM manipulation. I use these skills to design in the browser, rapidly creating iterative prototypes. I am competent with using Git to version control my projects, and Github to host my repositories, and my personal site. I have a keen eye for Typography, and an obsession over Page Readability.</p>
		<p>I currently reside in Portsmouth, UK whilst studying for a degree in Computer Science from the University of Portsmouth.</p>
