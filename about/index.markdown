Hey I'm Ed Poole, a Web designer from the United Kingdom. Originally from a small village near Aylesbury, I've found my home on the south of England, in Portsmouth. I am currently employed at [Radweb](http://radweb.co.uk) as a Graphic Designer whilst studying for a degree in Computer Science at the [University of Portsmouth](http://port.ac.uk).

I'm a designer at heart, however I still like to dive into front end code, helping me to bring my designs to life. I'm obsessed with OOCSS and how we can write more structured CSS that allows us to infinitely scale our web apps and sites. I've recently started to learn Backbone.js and I plan to build my final project with it.

You can find me all over the internet. My favourite playground is [dribbble](http://dribbble.com/edpoole). I post screenshots of my latest work to here. I also write code and stick it on [github](http://github.com/EdPoole) for the world to see. You can contact me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/_ewp).
