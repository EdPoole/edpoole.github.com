I'm a Web designer and developer from the United Kingdom. I am currently employed at [Radweb](http://radweb.co.uk) as a Graphic Designer whilst studying for a degree in Computer Science at the [University of Portsmouth](http://port.ac.uk).

I'm a designer at heart, however I still like to dive into front end code, helping me to bring my designs to life. I'm obsessed with OOCSS and how we can write more structured CSS that allows us to infinitely scale our web apps and sites. I've recently started to learn [meteor.js](http://meteor.com) and I plan to build my final year university project with it.

You can find my design stuff on [dribbble](http://dribbble.com/edpoole) and my code on [github](http://github.com/EdPoole). Fancy a chat? You can contact me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/_ewp), [skype](skype:edde.poole?add) and [email](mailto:ed@edpoole.me).
