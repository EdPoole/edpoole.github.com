Hey I'm Ed Poole, a Web designer and developer from the United Kingdom.

I am currently employed at [Radweb](http://radweb.co.uk) as a Graphic Designer whilst studying for a degree in Computer Science at the [University of Portsmouth](http://port.ac.uk).

You can usually find me [pushing pixels](http://dribbble.com/edpoole), [writing code](http://github.com/EdPoole), or [tweeting nonsense](http://twitter.com/_ewp).
