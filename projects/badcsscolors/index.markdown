Bad CSS Colors was a little "joke" site I put together, orginally based on the facebook posts from [webdesigntuts+](http://webdesgin.tutsplus.com). Every week, Ian Yates would post a colour combination with colours from the CSS spec - I simply automated this. You can visit Bad CSS Colors [here](http://badcsscolors.com).
